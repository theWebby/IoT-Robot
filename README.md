# IoT-Robot
For my third year module on the Internet of Things, we learned how to make IoT devices using Arduino C. For my project I made an autonamous robot using motors and ultrasonic sensors with the capability for manual control on a web server hosted on the ESP Feather.

The Arduino C file is called Ex15 (to conform to the IoT module naming conventions in labs). This is the file that should be loaded to the ESP.

The robot is also capable of handling manual control from another device connected to the same network with using REST.
